If you are on windows as stated in your post you appear to be using the wrong syntax. Are your group members using mac? If so this could be were the consusion stemmed
This issue can be easily resolved by following the windows syntax which in this case appears to be the use of colons as opposed to semi colons in your class path line at line one.

# Reflection:
I learned for one that solb=ving bugs with only a screenshot is extremely difficult. This fact has made me feel for the Ta's who spend their time helping students with only screenshots. In terms of the lab I feel it was interesting how simply messing up the class path can ruin the whole process of code.
